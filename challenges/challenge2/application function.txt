Challenge 2:

Write a function processApplicant that takes an object as its parameter representing applicant information.
The object should include fields such as
firstName, lastName, age, testGrade (on a scale of 1-10),maritalStatus (single or married) and gender (M or F).
If any of these fields are null, log "Application rejected, information not complete" to the console.

If the information is complete but the testGrade is below 6, add the applicant to a failedApplicant array and log "You failed the test,
Try again another time." to the console. If the testGrade is 6 or above,
 add the applicant to a newEmployee array and log "Congratulations! You got the job."

Test Cases:

Rejected Application:
let rejectedApplicant = {
    firstName: null,
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 25,
    testGrade: 8,
    maritalStatus: "single",
    gender: "M"
};
processApplicant(rejectedApplicant);




Failed Applicant:
let failedTestApplicant = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    age: 30,
    testGrade: 4,
    maritalStatus: "married",
    gender: "F"
};
processApplicant(failedTestApplicant);


Successful Applicant:
let successfulApplicant = {
    firstName: "Alice",
    lastName: "Johnson",
    age: 28,
    testGrade: 9,
    maritalStatus: "single",
    gender: "F"
};
processApplicant(successfulApplicant);
