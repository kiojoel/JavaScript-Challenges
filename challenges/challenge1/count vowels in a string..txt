
Challenge 1:

Count Vowels in a String

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it should count both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

Example:

Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: 3

Input: "Programming is fun"
Output: 5
